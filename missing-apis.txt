# Missing APIs - To be added to backend

## APIs found in frontend but not in our 69 backend endpoints:

1. GET /api/numbers - Dashboard statistics endpoint (used in AdminDashboard)
   - Should return: { students: number, teachers: number, classes: number, parents: number }
   - Used by: adminService.getNumbers()

(This file will be updated as we find missing APIs during screen rewrites)
